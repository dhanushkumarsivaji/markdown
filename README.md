**1. Repository Creation**
   - **Branches (main, develop, uat):**
     - Main: This is the stable version where your production-ready code resides. Create it using `git checkout -b main`.
     - Develop: This is where new features are developed and tested. Use `git checkout -b develop` to create it.
     - UAT (User Acceptance Testing): This branch is for testing by stakeholders. Create it with `git checkout -b uat`.
   - **Frontend Team Approver:** Assign one frontend team member as the approver for frontend changes. They should review and approve pull requests on your Git platform.
   - **Prevent Direct Commits:** Configure branch protection rules on your Git platform to prevent direct commits to main, develop, and uat branches.
   
**2. Artifact Creation (npm feed)**
   - **Allowing Upstream Resources:** In your project's `package.json`, add dependencies like this:
     ```json
     "dependencies": {
       "library-name": "^1.0.0"
     }
     ```
   - **Feed Connection â€“ Personal Access Token (npmrc):** Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on your package registry platform (e.g., npmjs.com) and use it for authentication. Create or update an `.npmrc` file in your project's root directory and add your PAT:
     
     Create an `.npmrc` file:
     ```bash
     touch .npmrc
     ```
     Open the `.npmrc` file and add your PAT:
     ```
     //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=<your-PAT>
     ```
     Then, run the following command to log in to the npm registry with your `.npmrc` configuration:
     ```bash
     npm login --registry=https://registry.npmjs.com --scope=@your-scope
     ```

This addition clarifies how to use an `.npmrc` file to securely store and use the Personal Access Token for authentication when connecting to the npm feed.

**3. Application Deployment - CI/CD Steps**
   - **Code Quality Check (Sonarqube/Veracode):** Set up Sonarqube or Veracode in your CI/CD pipeline to check code quality automatically.
   - **Package Installation:** Run the following command to install project dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - **Unit Testing:** Execute unit tests with a command like:
     ```bash
     npm test
     ```
   - **Building:** Build your project using:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - **Deploying:**
     - Deploying build files to Azure App Service (Containerized App):
       ```bash
       az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-service-name> --src <path-to-zip-file>
       ```
     - Deploying build files to Azure Storage Account (Micro App):
       ```bash
       az storage blob upload-batch -d <container-name> --type block --source <path-to-build-files>
       ```

**4. Library/Package Deployment - CI/CD Steps**
   - **Code Quality Check (Sonarqube/Veracode):** Similar to application code, set up code quality checks for your libraries.
   - **Package Installation:** Use this command to install library dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - **Unit Testing:** Run library unit tests with a command like:
     ```bash
     npm test
     ```
   - **Release (bumping up package version):** Increment the package version in your library's `package.json` file.
   - **Building:** Build your library using:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - **Publishing (to artifacts):** Publish your library to the npm registry or your artifact repository. For npm, use:
     ```bash
     npm publish
     ```

**5. Azure Resources for Deployment**
   - **Azure App Service (for deploying container application):** Create an Azure App Service instance in the Azure Portal and deploy your containerized application to it.
   - **Storage Account (for deploying micro application):** In the Azure Portal, create a Storage Account, upload your micro application files, and enable static website hosting.
